# Object-Recognition

**Problem Statement** : 
The development of reliable object recognition system for apt object recognition is still a challenge today. Requirement is to recognize the image regardless of position and rotation. Objects in images must be distinguished from their backgrounds. The major challenges in object detection are classifying objects and determining their
position. However for the computer to imitate and detect objects like a human eye is a major issue. Some of the problems incurred are variation of view points, illumination, shapes as well as sizes of the goal objects. Processed photographs of objects under various orientations are considered.The goal is to find an approach for detection of objects with high accuracy and maximum automation for a given input photograph. The language in which the code will be written using R and Jupyter.
